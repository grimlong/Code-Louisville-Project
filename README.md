# Code-Louisville-Project
<h1>My project for Code Louisville</h1>

<p>I made a travel site for a fictional place in the Dungeons & Dragons universe that a Dungeon Master can use to get their players prepared to start The Curse of Strahd adventure.</p>

<p>My navigation bar is a flexbox with icons from a site called Fontawesome. It is responsive and will move to the bottom of the screen and change from a drawer that pulls out on
hover to a banner that is fixed to the bottom. </p>

<p>The navigation bar also has javaScript that changes the theme of the nav bar. I plan to have it alter the whole page but I am want to learn more about UX to determine which
colors that should be used.</p>

<p>Most of the links go to an "under construction" page I created or a page I intend to use as reference the bottom of the page has a link to a page that houses a character Stats Generator I made with JavaScript</p> 

<p>I used the Live Server extension for VS code when I was writing it but, I think it should just work when you click the HTML file.</p>
